Bootcamp Week Two; (Advanced CSS) - Portfolio

Web Application built from scratch to function as a portfolio page.
This webpage is meant to showcase skills and talents to future employers.

The portfolio will present developer's name, recent photo and information about them, as well as contact information.

The page includes links for easy navigation.

When an image is clicked it will be shown larger than other images.

The page includes CSS functions like flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

Resizing the page or viewing it on different screens will present a responsive layout which adapts to the viewport.
